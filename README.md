![alt-text](images/Logo2.jpg)

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
  During the last term, we were tasked to make an app using React and Node that would help address the society's main concerns. We called our app SHAREBOOK, which stemmed from the word "share" and "book" because this app is all about sharing books that can still be used by other people. This features the ability to post books, specific genres, title, authors and number of pieces. 

## Societal concern
  Philippines has beem facing the problem of the youth's lack of education. There are different factors which are commonly financial reasons, emotional unreadiness and lack of resources. Lack of resources pertain to things need in the schools like educational supplies and books.

## Impact
  The students, most especially the youth are not able to utilize all the things they need for their education. As a concrete example, public school students are only allowed to borrow textbooks. For assignments and lectures, they can only answer the questions from the textbook on a seperate sheet of paper. Writing on the textbooks itself is not allowed since the same set of books will be used by the next batch. This would not maximize the students learning since they do not have direct reference.

## Statistics

## Suggestions
  Education of the youth should be of primary importance since they are the next generation. As concerned citizens, we believe that an initiative to help would be of great help. Thus this concept was created, called the sharebook. It is an app that allows people to post their unwanted or semi-used books and then it would be given free to the receiver.

## Scope and limitations:
  Right now, during the initial stage, our target is just to collect books. We wish to have a directory for the books and receivers but there is not enough time so we had to settle for the "doughnut" which is an app collecting used books up for post.
